A silly 3D game written in Processing, controlled by serial data from Arduino.

This project was a part of my final project for a digital electronics course. See my [pepper](http://github.com/montemishkin/pepper) repo for another game that was part of the same project. Also check out my [digital-electronics-final](http://github.com/montemishkin/digital-electronics-final) repo for the writeup that accompanied these two games.
